## General Information
We have been given that US based housing company Surprise Housing wants to enter into Australian market. They wants to buy houses on the low prices and sell on the high price.For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. So we are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
We have been provided with house details data set.
